        <h2 id="article">EASTERN EUROPE Blue hand for Ukraine in the Black Sea</h2>        
            <div>
                <p>Each sea basin has its own importance from different perspectives: economic, political, social, environmental and strategic. The Black Sea is not an exception. Even more: due to the very different coastal countries, Black sea has a difficult contradiction complex. Consequently, the Black Sea needs a regional or at least a sub-regional approach. In different sea basins EU is using various initiatives and approaches for gathering the actors and its actions. The aim of these initiatives are identify all aspects of cooperation and existing initiatives and to achieve maximum coherence between strategies of each country, thereby maximizing their effectiveness.</p>
                <p>
                    In 2019 EU gave a helping hand in the form of Common maritime agenda for the Black Sea (CMA) which can offer successful answers to some of the specific problems in this basin. The CMA cover all Black sea states: <a href="#"> Russia,</a> Bulgaria, Georgia, Moldova, Romania, Turkey and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine" target="blank"> Ukraine.</a> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    CMA includes the full range of issues related to Black Sea activities (infrastructure, transport, ecology, tourism, aquaculture, fisheries, digitalization, etc.), except political and security issues. Exception of the policy matters is one of the reasons of mechanism’ success. In addition, the European Commission has decided to separate the scientific component – SRIA.

                <p>The event objectives were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>to give a full picture of tools and assistance available in Ukraine for an effective implementation of the Common Maritime Agenda and its R&I Pillar (SRIA) for a healthy and sustainable blue economy.</li>
                    <li>to share issue and best practices on EU funding calls.</li>
                    <li>to provide practical guidance to the various stakeholders in the blue economy for Ukraine (Authorities, Universities, SMEs, CSOs, etc): what’s in it for them, which are the specific requirements to be eligible and what they have to gain from future financing streams.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Talking about the EU financial instruments within CMA instrument we can figure out eight:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Neighbour development and international cooperation instrument (target on special priorities of cooperation during 2021-2027.</li>
                    <li>Interreg next Black sea program 2021- 2027.</li>
                    <li>Horizon Europe.</li>
